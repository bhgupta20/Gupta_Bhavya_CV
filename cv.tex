    I am an \textbf{A3D3 Post-Baccalaureate Fellow at MIT} and a recent graduate of UC San Diego with a B.S. in Physics (Specialization in Astrophysics). During my undergraduate studies, I developed computational techniques and data analysis skills while investigating various astrophysical phenomena. My research projects have ranged from investigating the ionized gas in the interstellar medium of young, star-forming galaxies to modeling dark matter through stellar stream interactions and dynamics. My current work focuses on developing machine-learning methods for real-time gravitational-wave detection. I aim to \textbf{advance multi-messenger astrophysics by applying modern AI techniques} to uncover new physical insights from the rapidly growing volume of astronomical data as \textbf{I pursue a PhD}.

% The datetabular environment takes one argument, which is the width of the left date column. As seen here:
%   9em is a good choice for "dual-date" formats (e.g. Sep 2015 - Nov 2019).
%   4em is a good choice for month/year dates (Sep 2014).
%   2em is a good choice for year-only dates (as seen in the publications)
\begin{datetabular}{9em}
% This is just a tabular environment, for the most part. The date entry command has been defined for

\textit{Streams} x \textit{Machine Learning - Undergraduate Researcher}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Worked with Professor Javier Duarte and Professor Tongyan Lin on modeling the interactions between dark matter (DM) subhalos and stellar streams, examining spurs and gaps to infer the dynamical properties of these subhalos and understand their distribution in the galaxy.
    \item Adapted Denise Erkal's \href{https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/450/1/1136/1008580}{analytic equations} for modeling velocity perturbations in stellar streams due to DM subhalos flyby, using \texttt{Gala} and \texttt{Galpy} stream generation methods. 
    \item Validated that synthetic streams closely match the analytic predictions and understood how the different DM subhalo properties affect stream morphology and kinematics, thereby helping us put constraints on these properties.
    \item Addressed the limitations of traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, which rely on tractable likelihood functions to recover DM subhalo parameters, by employing advanced Machine Learning (ML) techniques such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Normalizing Flows (nflows), and Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) for scenarios where likelihoods are intractable.
    \item Modified GNN models and fine-tuned nflows architectures to analyze and model complex posterior distributions to recover the impact properties of DM subhalos from synthetic stellar streams.
    \item Evaluated and compared MCMC and SBI approaches for inferring DM subhalo parameters, revealing that SBI, despite its potential, did not achieve the expected efficiency and often produced broader posterior distributions compared to the narrower, more accurate posteriors from MCMC.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Worked with Carnegie Staff Astronomer Peter Senchyna to investigate the young, star-forming galaxies in the local universe (z < 1) to understand the distribution of highly-ionized [C II] and [O III] gas, using local analogs to study early galactic formation due to the challenges involved in observing high-redshift galaxies.
    \item Probed the structure of the Interstellar Medium (ISM) in local analogs to see if they were elevated in [O III] emission in comparison to [C II] as observed in high-redshift systems (z > 6).
    \item Analyzed [O III] and [C II] emission lines from SOFIA data cubes using the SOSPEX package, focusing on flux extraction, and examining ionized gas properties by validating results through comparison with the Dwarf Galaxy Survey (DGS).
    \item Identified that [C II] is not suppressed; there is strong lower ionization emission in photodissociation regions of the highly-ionized local analogs in contrast with high-redshift systems observed with ALMA, suggesting differences in the ISM structure.
    \item Received \$6,000 stipend for the research work.
